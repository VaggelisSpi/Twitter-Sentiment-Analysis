# DataMiningProject

Course project for the Data Mining Class of the Departement of Informatic of the National and Kapodistrian University.

In this project the task was to perform sentiment analysis in tweets. We performed the classification using 2 different classifiers, SVM and kNN and for each we tried 3 different ways of vectorization, bag of words, TF-IDF and word embeddings. We also performed text preproccessing in order to increase the accuracy.
